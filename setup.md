You need to download some files to follow this lesson. First, you need to open a terminal:

- **On Windows:** run "Git Bash", which you installed as part of the software prerequisites
- **On Mac OS X:** accessed by opening the “Terminal” application, which can be found in the “Utilities” folder which is in your “Applications” folder
- **On Linux:** this will depend on the Linux distribution you are running, but you should be able to find a "Terminal" application in your desktop's application menu

Once you've done this, a window should appear. Type the following into the prompt that appears (pressing enter/return after each line):

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Alternatively, if you have SSH authentication with GitHub enabled (if you dont know what this means dont worry, it is covered in the Git SWC course if you want to know more!) you can use the following:

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:Southampton-RSG/swc-shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This should download all the content for the lesson to a new directory.
Please let the instructors know if you run into any problems.
