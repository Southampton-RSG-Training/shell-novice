# Setup for Lesson
## Text Editor ##

A text editor is the piece of software you use to view and write code. If you
have a preferred text editor, please use it. Suggestions for text editors are,
Notepad++ (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), Gedit (GNU/Linux), GNU Nano, Vim.
Alternatively, there are IDE's (integrated developer environments) that have
more features specifically for coding such as VS Code; there are also IDEs
specific to languages will be listed in the appropriate section(s) below.
## Open a Terminal ##

For this lesson, first you need to be able to open a terminal:

- **On Windows:** run "Git Bash", to install git bash go here [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) click download and select 'Git-X.XX.X-64-bit.exe' from the assets list.
- **On Mac OS X:** accessed by opening the “Terminal” application, which can be found in the “Utilities” folder which is in your “Applications” folder.
- **On Linux:** this will depend on the Linux distribution you are running, but you should be able to find a "Terminal" application in your desktop's application menu.


## Git Setup ##

### Windows
We'll be using Git Bash for both git and a shell to run it in. If you've already installed Git Bash then go to the next section. Otherwise, go to [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click **Download**, then install it. 
Most of the options can be left on default, but be sure you check these:

- **Choosing the default editor used by Git:** Make sure **Nano** is selected from the drop-down. If you're comfortable with other editors, feel free to change it, but we recommend Nano - we use it as it's present on Windows, Mac *and* Linux. If you change it, you might not quite match what we're doing on-screen.
- **Adjusting your PATH environment:** Make sure **Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software** is selected.
- **Choosing HTTPS transport backend:** Make sure **Use the native Windows Secure Channel Library** is selected.
- **Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash:** Make sure **Use Windows' default console window** is selected.

#### Mac OS
To use Git you must install the Apple Command Line Tools, this may take a few minutes.  

You can obtain these [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?name=command%20line%20tools%20for%20xcode%2012) (requires your Apple ID)

- Select **Command Line Tools for Xcode 12 (or higher)** and click the link to download the dmg archive.
- If prompted, choose to allow downloads from developer.apple.com
- Open the downloaded dmg archive from the Downloads folder
- Double-click the Command Line Tools.pkg icon to install

Alternatively, you can install the tools from the command line:

~~~
$ xcode-select --install
~~~
{: .language-bash}

#### Linux
Git comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. You can test if it's installed by running `git --version`. 
If it's not installed, you can install it by running `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo yum install git`, depending on 
your distribution.

## GitHub ##
We'll be using the website [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host, back up, and distribute our code. You'll need to [create an account there](https://github.com/signup). As your GitHub username will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.

## Download Data for Shell Lesson ##

Type the following into the prompt that appears (pressing enter/return after each line):

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`cd` will move to your home directory, and `git clone` will download a copy of the materials.

Alternatively, if you have SSH authentication with GitHub enabled (if you don't know what this means don't worry, it is covered in the Git SWC course if you want to know more!) you can use the following:

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This should download all the content for the lesson to a new directory.
Please let the instructors know if you run into any problems.
