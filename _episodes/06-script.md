questions:
- "How can I save and re-use commands?"
objectives:
- "Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files."
- "Run a shell script from the command line."
- "Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line."
- "Create pipelines that include user-written shell scripts."
keypoints:
- "Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use."
- "`bash [filename]` runs the commands saved in a file."
- "`$@` refers to all of a shell scriptâ€™s command-line arguments."
- "`$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc."
- "Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them."
- "Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands."

We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files
so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.
For historical reasons,
a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a **shell script**,
but make no mistake:
these are actually small programs.

### Our first shell script

Let's start by going back to `data` and putting some commands into a new file called `middle.sh` using an editor like `nano`:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ cd ~/shell-novice/data
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

So why the .sh extension to the filename? Adding `.sh` is the convention to show that this is a Bash shell script.

Enter the following line into our new file:

{: .bash}
~~~
head -15 sc_climate_data_1000.csv | tail -5
~~~

Then save it and exit `nano` (using `Control-O` to save it and then `Control-X` to exit `nano`).

This pipe selects lines 11-15 of the file `sc_climate_data_1000.csv`. It selects the first 15
lines of that file using `head`, then passes that to `tail` to show us only the last 5 lines - hence lines 11-15.
Remember, we are *not* running it as a command just yet:
we are putting the commands in a file.

Once we have saved the file,
we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
Our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ bash middle.sh
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
299196.8188,972890.0521,48.07,61.41,0.78
324196.8188,972890.0521,48.20,-9999.00,0.72
274196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,60.94,0.83
275196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,61.27,0.83
248196.8188,961890.0521,46.22,58.98,1.43
~~~

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.

{: .callout}

### Enabling our script to run on any file

What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
We could edit `middle.sh` each time to change the filename,
but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.
Instead,
let's edit `middle.sh` and replace `sc_climate_data_1000.csv` with a special variable called `$1`:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
head -15 "$1" | tail -5
~~~

Inside a shell script,
`$1` means the first filename (or other argument) passed to the script on the command line.
We can now run our script like this:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ bash middle.sh sc_climate_data_1000.csv
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
299196.8188,972890.0521,48.07,61.41,0.78
324196.8188,972890.0521,48.20,-9999.00,0.72
274196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,60.94,0.83
275196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,61.27,0.83
248196.8188,961890.0521,46.22,58.98,1.43
~~~

or on a different file like this (our full data set!):

{: .bash}
~~~
$ bash middle.sh sc_climate_data.csv
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
299196.8188,972890.0521,48.07,61.41,0.78
324196.8188,972890.0521,48.20,-9999.00,0.72
274196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,60.94,0.83
275196.8188,968890.0521,47.86,61.27,0.83
248196.8188,961890.0521,46.22,58.98,1.43
~~~

Note the output is the same, since our full data set contains the same first 1000 lines as `sc_climate_data_1000.csv`.

> ## Double-Quotes Around Arguments
>
> We put the `$1` inside of double-quotes in case the filename happens to contain any spaces.
> The shell uses whitespace to separate arguments,
> so we have to be careful when using arguments that might have whitespace in them.
> If we left out these quotes, and `$1` expanded to a filename like
> `climate data.csv`,
> the command in the script would effectively be:
> ~~~
> head -15 climate data.csv | tail -5
> ~~~
> This would call `head` on two separate files, `climate` and `data.csv`,
> which is probably not what we intended.
{: .callout}

### Adding more arguments to our script

However, if we want to adjust the range of lines to extract, we still need to edit `middle.sh` each time.
Less than ideal!
Let's fix that by using the special variables `$2` and `$3`. These represent the second and third arguments passed on the command line:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
head "$2" "$1" | tail "$3"
~~~

So now we can pass the `head` and `tail` line range arguments to our script:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ bash middle.sh sc_climate_data_1000.csv -20 -5
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
252196.8188,961890.0521,46.22,60.94,1.43
152196.8188,960890.0521,48.81,-9999.00,1.08
148196.8188,959890.0521,48.81,59.43,1.08
325196.8188,957890.0521,48.20,61.36,0.72
326196.8188,957890.0521,47.44,61.36,0.80
~~~

This does work,
but it may take the next person who reads `middle.sh` a moment to figure out what it does.
We can improve our script by adding some **comments** at the top:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ cat middle.sh
~~~

{: .output}
~~~
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: middle.sh filename -end_line -num_lines
head "$2" "$1" | tail "$3"
~~~

In Bash, a comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they're invaluable for helping people understand and use scripts.

A line or two of documentation like this make it much easier for other people
(including your future self) to re-use your work.
The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
you should check that its comments are still accurate:
an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.


### Processing multiple files

What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
For example, if we want to sort our `.csv` files by length, we would type:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ wc -l *.csv | sort -n
~~~

This is because `wc -l` lists the number of lines in the files
(recall that wc stands for 'word count', adding the `-l` flag means 'count lines' instead)
and `sort -n` sorts things numerically.
We could put this in a file,
but then it would only ever sort a list of `.csv` files in the current directory.
If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
we need a way to get all those names into the script.
We can't use `$1`, `$2`, and so on
because we don't know how many files there are.
Instead, we use the special variable `$@`,
which means,
"All of the command-line parameters to the shell script."
We also should put `$@` inside double-quotes
to handle the case of parameters containing spaces
(`"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1"` `"$2"` ...)

Here's an example. Edit a new file called `sort.sh`:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ nano sorted.sh
~~~

And in that file enter:

{: .output}
~~~
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
~~~
When we run it with some wildcarded file arguments:

{: .bash}
~~~
$ bash sorted.sh *.csv ../shell/test_directory/creatures/*.dat
~~~

We have the following output:

{: .output}
~~~
      11 sc_climate_data_10.csv
     155 ../shell/test_directory/creatures/minotaur.dat
     163 ../shell/test_directory/creatures/basilisk.dat
     163 ../shell/test_directory/creatures/unicorn.dat
    1001 sc_climate_data_1000.csv
 1048576 sc_climate_data.csv
 1050069 total

Again, we should explain what we are trying to do here using a comment, for example:

{: .bash}
~~~
# List given files sorted by number of lines
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
~~~

> Here's something that can be useful as an aid to memory.

> that created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.
> We'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to,
> so we want to save the commands in a file.
> Instead of typing them in again
> (and potentially getting them wrong)
> we can do this:
>
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> $ history | tail -4 > redo-figure-3.sh
> ~~~
>
> The file `redo-figure-3.sh` now contains:
>
> ~~~
> 297 bash goostats -r NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
> 298 bash goodiff stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt > 01729-differences.txt

> ~~~
>
> After a moment's work in an editor to remove the historical reference number for each command (e.g. 297, 298),

The `*.*` wildcard matches anything in the current directory with a `.` in the file (or folder!) name, so it expands to a list of all files in the directory, *including* `example.sh`. Then it passes that list to `echo`, which prints them out.

The script then takes the first 3 arguments (using `$1 $2 $3`) and uses `cat` to print the contents of the file. However, if there are more than 3 files in the directory with the `.dat` suffix, they'll be ignored. If there are *less* than 3, there'll be an error!
