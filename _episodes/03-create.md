We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?

First, let's check where we are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/shell-novice/shell/test_directory
~~~
{: .output}

If you're not in this directory, use the `cd` command to navigate to it as covered in the last lesson, for example:

~~~
$ cd ~/shell-novice/shell/test_directory
~~~
{: .language-bash}

### Creating a new directory

Now let's use `ls -F` to see what our test directory contains:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/
~~~
{: .output}
Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

~~~
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
{: .bash}
As you might (or might not) guess from its name,
`mkdir` means "make directory".
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
creatures/  north-pacific-gyre/  thesis/
data/       notes.txt            writing/
Desktop/    pizza.cfg
molecules/  solar.pdf
~~~
{: .output}

However, there's nothing in it yet - this will show no output:

~~~
$ ls -F thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

### Creating a new text file

Now we'll create a new file using a text editor in this new directory.

> ## Which Editor?
>
> When we say, "`nano` is a text editor," we really do mean "text": it can
> only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
> human-friendly media. We use it in examples because almost anyone can
> drive it anywhere without training, but please use something more
> powerful for real work.
>
> On Windows, you may wish to use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
> A more powerful example is Microsoft's [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
> It's a fairly standard text editor that can be
> installed on Windows, Mac or Linux but also has some handy features like
> code highlighting that make it easy to write scripts and code. Similar
> editors exist like [Atom](https://atom.io/), a highly customisable text editor which
> also runs on these platforms.
>
> Your choice of editor will depend on the size of project you're working on,
> and how comfortable you are with the terminal.
{: .callout}

Let's first change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
and then we'll use the `Nano` editor to create a text file called `draft.txt`, and then save it in that directory.

~~~
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We add a filename after the `nano` command to tell it that we want to edit (or in this case create) a file.

Now, let's type in a few lines of text, for example:

![Nano in action](fig/nano-screenshot.png)

Once we have a few words, to save this data in a new `draft.txt` file we then use `Control-O` (pressing `Control` and the letter `O` at the same time), and then press
`Enter` to confirm the filename.

Once our file is saved,
we can use `Control-X` to quit the editor and return to the shell.
`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

Now we've saved the file, we can use `ls` to see that there is a new file in the directory called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We can use the shell on its own to take a look at its contents using the `cat` command (which we can use to print the contents of files):

~~~
$ cat draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
It's not "publish or perish" any more,
it's "share and thrive".
~~~
{: .output}

### Deleting files and directories

Now, let's assume we didn't actually need to create this file. We can delete it by running `rm draft.txt`:

~~~
$ rm draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This command removes files (`rm` is short for "remove").
If we run `ls` again,
its output is empty once more,
which tells us that our file is gone:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Deleting Is Forever
>
> The Bash shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
> files from.  Instead,
> when we delete files, they are unhooked from the file system so that
> their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
> recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
> work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
> file's disk space right away.
{: .callout}

But what if we want to delete a directory, perhaps one that already contains a file? Let's re-create that file
and then move up one directory using `cd ..`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
/Users/nelle/shell-novice/test_directory/thesis
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
$ nano draft.txt
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
$ cd ..
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
/Users/nelle/shell-novice/shell/test_directory
~~~
{: .output}

If we try to remove the entire `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~
$ rm thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~
{: .error}

On a Mac, it may look a bit different (`rm: thesis: is a directory`), but means the same thing.

This happens because `rm` only works on files, not directories.
The right command is `rmdir`,
which is short for "remove directory".
It doesn't work yet either, though,
because the directory we're trying to remove isn't empty (again, it may look a bit different on a Mac):

~~~
$ rmdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
rmdir: failed to remove `thesis': Directory not empty
~~~
{: .error}

This little safety feature can save you a lot of grief,
particularly if you are a bad typist.
To really get rid of `thesis` we must first delete the file `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ rm thesis/draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The directory is now empty, so `rmdir` can delete it:

~~~
$ rmdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
>
> Removing the files in a directory just so that we can remove the
> directory quickly becomes tedious. Instead, we can use `rm` with the
> `-r` flag (which stands for "recursive"):
>
> ~~~
> $ rm -r thesis
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> This removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself. If
> the directory contains sub-directories, `rm -r` does the same thing to
> them, and so on. It's very handy, but can do a lot of damage if used
> without care.
{: .callout}


### Renaming and moving files and directories

Let's create that directory and file one more time.

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
/Users/user/shell-novice/shell/test_directory
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Again, put anything you like in this file (note we're giving the `thesis` path to `nano` as well as the `draft.txt` filename, so we create it in that directory):

~~~
$ nano thesis/draft.txt
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

`draft.txt` isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for "move":

~~~
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first parameter tells `mv` what we're "moving",
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` (the file `draft.txt` in the `thesis` directory) to `thesis/quotes.txt` (the `quotes.txt` again in the `thesis` directory),
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Just for the sake of inconsistency,
`mv` also works on directories --- there is no separate `mvdir` command.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename,
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called "move".)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

~~~
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Further,
`ls` with a filename or directory name as a parameter only lists that file or directory.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

### Copying files

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as parameters --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given thousands of paths at once:

~~~
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .output}

To prove that we made a copy,
let's delete the `quotes.txt` file in the current directory
and then run that same `ls` again (we can get to this command by pressing the up arrow twice).

~~~
$ rm quotes.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory
thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .error}

This time it tells us that it can't find `quotes.txt` in the current directory,
but it does find the copy in `thesis` that we didn't delete.
